export const SuitAndTie = `Reverend, reverend, please come quick
'Cause I've got something to admit
I met a man out in the sticks of Good Ol' Miss
He drove a series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
Saw him driving down the 61 in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

And he said
I know you, I know you young man
I know you by the state of your hands
You're a six-string picker
Just as I, I am
Let me learn you something
I know a few turns to make all the girls dance
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down the 61 in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

Oh
Foolish, foolish was I
Damn my foolish eyes
'Cause that man's lessons
Had a price, oh, sweet price
My sweet soul, everlasting
A very own eternal light`;

export const SoManyMoons = `So many moons come and gone
Stripes and more stripes tigers and more tigers
And the luxury hotel to sleep in
Dreams and more dreams kisses and more kisses
What will remain of so much moon
What will remain of so much water so much thirst
so much drinking glass
Window destined for you
So you can depend on it more perfect
You make of your beauty
What others make of the sky`;

export const SpokeAndSage = `A man sure of anything is surely right about nothing.

A prideful spoke preaching what he learned but once,
An enlightened sage lets wisdom flow inside like blood.
The spoke asks, 'What's the use of knowledge without giving it to town?'
The sage asks, 'What towns there have been that haven't been torn down?'

For it is man that holds the water prisoner,
It is man that breaches the rock beneath the soil.
It is man that believes he holds kinship over essence,
And essence will sweep away man and his teachings,
Like ash out the car window on the interstate.

So what is this script but another lifeless preaching?
For I am a spoke, and pride I'm seeking.
And I can draw you back that thin-veiled curtain,
But there is still one thing I know for certain:

A man sure of anything is surely right about nothing.`;
export const WokeUpToday = `I woke up today under concrete slabs.
 The ones above bind to the ones below.
 Dread fills me.
 I know there is nowhere to go.

 I woke up today to muffled screams.
 I search for them but cannot see.
 Do they scream to help themselves?
 Or do they scream to help me?

 I woke up today
 To a slaughter.

 A slaughter of love and hate.
 A slaughter of joy and despair.
 A slaughter of my loving wife, playing with my hair.
 A slaughter of bowling with my friends on Friday nights in June
 And a slaughter of playing my guitar while howling at the moon.

 I woke up today,
 And all I feel is vertigo.

 A type of nausea I used to seek,
 Spinning round, round and round
 On a playground near a creek.

 All I feel is vertigo.

 In my brain, it cracks a leak.
 Spinning round, round and round,
 The whirlwind makes me weak.

 All I see is a sliver of light.

 It used to help me sleep on time.
 As the flames rolled over the horizon,
 My only thought: will she be mine?

 All I see is a sliver of light.

 Counting down like laps on a track,
 As the flames roll over the horizon,
 Will it stop when my eyes roll back?

 I woke up today.

 The muffled screams I used to hear,
 All but mine are silenced,
 But they still ring through my ear.

 The concrete slabs that bury me
 Are held by hope to some degree.
 But hope can't hold like steel, so
 Scriptless tombstones they will be.

 I woke up today.

 And I know this is my last...

 Help is not coming, but I am sick...

 And the others I share this condition with
 Are lost to the bucket I'm about to kick.`;
export const GraceAndJack = `Grace and Jack had quite a bond they thought everlasting, though,
It seemed as the flowers ripened, the love wilted so.
It didn't take long for Grace to move on to the next stag in the meadow,
And Jack sat there in lone despair. 'cause Grace threw Jack aside.

But he came to, 'cause if it's true there's a Jill for every Jack.
He found one fast he knew would last; they made the lifelong pact.
But not for long was the celebration; he needed something she lacked.
So Jill sat there with tear-matted hair. 'cause Jack threw Jill aside.

But Jill found herself jumping for joy 'cause she met a man so fine,
A proper-mannered, sweet boy Will, he'd stay for the rest of time.
But the clock ticked and ticked; from the wall, it dripped. till she seemed to lose her mind.
And Will cried in a room he once shared. 'cause Jill threw Will aside.

Now, there's something I've learned in life, that I feel I must confide:
Ends are sometimes funny, and they almost never rhyme.

But Will wanted that love so bad; y'know, he would've died.
and this ending just so happens to be he bit down on cyanide.`;
export const BrookInTheCity = `The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
With the new city street it has to wear
A number in. But what about the brook
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
And impulse, having dipped a finger length
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed
A flower to try its currents where they crossed.
The meadow grass could be cemented down
From growing under pavements of a town;
The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.
Is water wood to serve a brook the same?
How else dispose of an immortal force
No longer needed? Staunch it at its source
With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown
Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
In fetid darkness still to live and run --
And all for nothing it had ever done
Except forget to go in fear perhaps.
No one would know except for ancient maps
That such a brook ran water. But I wonder
If from its being kept forever under,
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep
This new-built city from both work and sleep.`;
export const StoppingByWoods = `Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.`;
export const Lungs = `Won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing.
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
Pray the day ain't poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision.

Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool, it's only moonlight.
If you try to take it home
Your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
Try to find another.

Salvation sat and crossed herself
Called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at it's mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in Fiery Answer

Jesus was an only son
Love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues
Dirty up the doorstep
I for one and you for two
Ain't got the time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you
We'll tell the world we tried`
